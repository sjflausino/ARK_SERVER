# ARK: Survival Evolved Server on AWS (via Terraform)

This repository sets up an ARK: Survival Evolved server on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. It also configures automated backups using AWS S3, installs SteamCMD, and manages the server with RCON.

## Requirements

- **Terraform**: Version 1.x or higher
- **AWS CLI**: Version 2.x or higher
- **AWS Account** with IAM user permissions for creating EC2, S3, IAM Key Pairs, etc.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjflausino/ark-server.git
cd ark-server
```

### 2. Set Up AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials. Run the following:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.

### 3. Customize Terraform Variables

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file to set your variables:

```hcl
aws_region       = "us-east-1"           # AWS region
s3_bucket_name   = "ark-server-backup"   # S3 bucket name for backups
ami_id           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # AWS AMI ID (Ubuntu or other)
instance_type    = "t3.medium"           # EC2 instance type
ssh_key_name     = "ark-server-key"      # SSH key name
ssh_public_key   = "ark-server-key.pub"  # Path to your SSH public key
```

### 4. Initialize Terraform

Run the following to initialize your Terraform working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration

Now, apply the Terraform configuration to create the EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and other resources:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 6. Connect to the EC2 Instance

Once the resources are created, you can SSH into your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i ark-server-key.pem ubuntu@<YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
```

Replace `<YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP>` with the actual public IP of your EC2 instance.

### 7. Install ARK: Survival Evolved Server

Run the following command to install the ARK server using SteamCMD:

```bash
steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/ubuntu/ark-server +app_update 376030 validate +quit
```

### 8. Starting the ARK Server

Start the ARK server with the following command:

```bash
/home/ubuntu/ark-server/ShooterGame/Binaries/Linux/ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen -server -log &
```

### 9. Set Up Automated Backups (Optional)

Backups are configured to run daily at 3:00 AM. If you'd like to adjust the backup schedule, update the cron job by editing:

```bash
crontab -e
```

The cron job should look like this:

```bash
0 3 * * * tar -czvf /home/ubuntu/ark-backup.tar.gz /home/ubuntu/ark-server && aws s3 cp /home/ubuntu/ark-backup.tar.gz s3://${var.s3_bucket_name}/
```

### 10. RCON Setup

To list players or manage the server, you'll need to enable RCON in `GameUserSettings.ini`. Update the file with the following:

```ini
RCONEnabled=True
RCONPort=32330
ServerAdminPassword=your_rcon_password
```

Use `mcrcon` to connect:

```bash
mcrcon -H 127.0.0.1 -P 32330 -p your_rcon_password "listplayers"
```

### 11. Terminating Resources

When you're done, destroy the resources created by Terraform to avoid unwanted charges:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
